Just an online learning system

bovine was created with a simple goal; to create an online learning system that works.  A virtual classroom with all the bull power, none of the feces.  bovine will provide a wide range of features that will enable teachers and instructors to stop worrying about management and syntax issues and get back to doing what their good at.

bovine is aimed towards a system that will allow for easy integration of modules and stylesheets through npm, while providing a simple, user-friendly interface that anyone can work with comfortably.  Upon initial startup, bovine will search for existing configuration objects in the database.  If none are found, a new configuration object is created to help you get started.

installation
===

To install bovine, simply run `npm install bovine`.  Once installed, the server can be started with `npm start` or through `node app.js`

When run using `node app.js`, bovine will accept the launch parameters `host` (`[--host | --h | -h hostname]`), `port` (`[--port | --p | or -p port]`), `environment` (`[--env | --e | -e { 0 for production, 1 for development, 2 for testing } ]`)
