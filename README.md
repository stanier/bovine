Just an online learning system

###the goal

Education is not a game.  Online learning is proven to work, and it's about time we make it work for real.  It's time to grab
the bull by the horns and make something that students everywhere can use and systen admins can deploy with ease.

###the plan

To make a system with all the power of a bull, without all the bull feces.

###why it's going to be better

I have nothing against moodle and BlackBoard.  They are both great tools.  But as the internet evolves, so must our online
learning systems.  It's time for us to make a scalable, self-maintaining system that works.  Something that can be deployed in
minutes and require less backend work from IT.

bovine combines the power of Node, Express and Angular to give a sleek, easy-to-use system with a minimal footprint.  This is
not a PHP app that requires cron tasks to execute every now and then.  This is a full educational quite that can be installed
and configured within the hour.
