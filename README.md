Just an online learning system

bovine was created with a simple goal; to create an online learning system that works.  A virtual classroom with all the bull power, none of the feces.  bovine will provide a wide range of features that will enable teachers and instructors to stop worrying about management and syntax issues and get back to doing what their good at.
